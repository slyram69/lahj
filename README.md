Proposal for project

The website that I would like to propose is the love and honor jesus web-site http://www.loveandhonorjesus.com. The reason is because I worked for love and honor jesus and I uploaded all the images on this site. The owner purchased the website from 1&1 myWebsite and I helped her choose the template and upload the images also I made some of, if not most of the Jewelry.

“category”: "item name": "color": "size": "price":

the above items are in my database and the category is the object, when products are selected and colors and sizes are selected the database will push the selection to the cart and at that point the customer will decide on the quantity. So the only relation is between the database and the shopping cart at this point.

API Model Description Response body Request body

GET/api/category Gets category items ?

GET/api/Category/{id} Get an item by ID Category item

POST/api/Category Add a new item Category item Category item

Push to PayPal

I will be using EJS and in regards to authentication the site that I’m doing doesn’t have it, but I guess we will talk about that. Also the website will be hosted on Heroku. My goals for the week are as follows: Monday - To create my database and start on my Website and get as far as I can and everyday after that will be to progress as much as possible.
